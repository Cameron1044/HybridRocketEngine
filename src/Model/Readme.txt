This folder will house the final Liquid Solid Hybrid Model for HADES engine

Primary Notes:
Liquid Model   -   Zillac-Karabeyoglu Model
Solid Model    -   Fuel Regression Marxman-Gilbert relation

FullModel.py is a attempt at ODE45

FUllModelEuler.py is conerting Rhodes Model from English to Metric to prepare for Liquid Blowdown ZK Model
    Note: Fuel regression rates scalars n and burn-coefficient a have been changed to better fit Rhode Data.
